                            Welcome to the Biomedical Engineering Department. Our program is dedicated to advancing
                            human health through the development and application of engineering principles and
                            technology to the medical field. We provide a multidisciplinary education that bridges the
                            gap between engineering and medicine. Our curriculum includes courses in biomechanics,
                            biomaterials, medical imaging, and bioinstrumentation. Students are equipped with the skills
                            to innovate in areas such as medical devices, diagnostics, and therapeutic technologies.
                            Join us in our mission to improve the quality of life through engineering solutions in
                            healthcare.
