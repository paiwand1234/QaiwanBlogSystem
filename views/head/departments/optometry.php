                            Welcome to the Optometry Department. Our program is dedicated to training future
                            optometrists who will provide exceptional eye care and vision services. We offer a
                            comprehensive curriculum that includes courses in ocular anatomy, visual science, clinical
                            optometry, and optical instrumentation. Students will gain hands-on experience in diagnosing
                            and managing eye diseases, prescribing corrective lenses, and providing vision therapy. Our
                            state-of-the-art facilities are equipped with the latest technology to ensure students are
                            well-prepared for their careers. Join us to make a difference in the field of eye care and
                            help improve the vision and quality of life for your patients.
